## Needed libraries for usage:

## Steps to be followed:

### To find the path to your database:

1) Click on the data file
2) Right click then click "Properties".
3) Copy the "location" text
4) Paste it into the first input it asks.
 
or you could just type the file path by hand if it does not work

### Email address

Just type any email address like: 
 
1)gmail.com
 
2)yahoo.com

now note that you should only type the part after the "@" in any email address for example:
  
in "example.id@gmail.com" you only have to type gmail.com

### Sub Heading
Type the subheading under which your names are present. for example in my example database file **_"Name"_** is the sub-heading under which the names are present and note this programs will only accept the names seperated by **_"//"_** and the names need to have _**3 words**_ in them.
